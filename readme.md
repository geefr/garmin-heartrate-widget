# ANT+ HR from Garmin watch

I'm using the CooSpo adapter. They link to [This PDF for drivers](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91VK9flfq7L.pdf)

That links directly to thisisant downloads for [USB2 drivers](http://www.thisisant.com/assets/resources/Software%20Tools/ant_usb2_drivers.zip)

```
Pip install -r requirements.txt
python hr.py
```
